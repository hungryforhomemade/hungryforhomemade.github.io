Welcome to Hungry for Homemade. A site for food connoisseurs who have missed homemade in this fast paced world. Homemade food and its simplicity is a slowly loosing culture, which needs to resurrected to the modern day needs.

Homemade food requires time to carefully craft a taste which only handful of us know. With the advent of fast foods, all foods now taste the same. But we know there was better food, which was fresh, where everything was crafted with hands, which is not made as an assembly line process.

How do we get that food, How do we share these tastes with the next generation or our friends? That is the question we want to embark upon. Come join us and feel how homemade tastes like.
